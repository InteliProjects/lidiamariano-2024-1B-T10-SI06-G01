1433;9/ To be clear, Uber's international fuck-ups ? particularly the $2B haircut it took in China ? were nearly all borne of hubris, and if the company ultimately fails, its int'l expansion attempts will very likely be a key reason, considering how much more $ they'd have w/o them.;-1

1438;4/ Ironically, the reason European cabbies harbor so much animus against Uber drivers ? people who've done nothing wrong ? is due to concerns over losing their golden geese, considering they're some of the highest-paid drivers on the planet thanks to protectionist trade policies.;-1
1439;"3/ ...namely Kalanick writing, ""Violence guarantee [sic] success"" (in terms of PR). Absent the above context: yes, it sounds vaguely like he's saying attacks against Uber's own drivers are helpful ? but *with* this context the suggestion lacks basic common sense.";-1
